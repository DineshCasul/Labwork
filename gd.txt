hello!
before starting let me ask you a quick question.. how many of you play video games on daily basis??

or weekly basis.. ?

any pubg player here? okay great!

do you have any idea how long did it take for pubg to roll out its first release??

for a team of 100, it took around 60000 hours. and it is still under development.

not only pubg, today multiplayer games are so much in demand that developers constantly putting their sweat in bringing out the new content.

back in early days, ping pong, galaga, mario contra spartn x etc, then gta igi doom, 

gaming industry is booming. stats.

AAA vs indie.

how it all started, the process of game dev and future of game dev.
